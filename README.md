*Note: I just updated the main code to a newer version, I also refactored most of the code to ES6 standards.*

A quite complex galaxy generater based on the work seen [here](http://loewald.com/galaxy).
I'm currently making a game that needed a generated galaxy, so I thought that someone else could maybe use this tool as well.

Have fun!
